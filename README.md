QuickBiz is a smart card prototype that uses the latest QR technology for you to store any kind of information - whether it be websites, email addresses, text messages, events, contact information, or physical locations. You can customise the QR code in any shape or colours, and either a physical or a digital smart card. 

The technology is limitless and the opportunities are endless. You can literally turn your personalised smart card into anything you want, especially if you’ve got a business and are wanting to make a business card. If that’s you and you don’t want to print 500 business cards, or simply want a nicely custom designed physically or digitally printed card, then do consider reaching out to us.
